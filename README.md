## Why this Project?

>Testing is an important part of the development process many organizations practice a standard of development known as "test-driven development". This is when developers write tests first, before they ever start developing their application. All the tests initially fail and then they start writing application code to make these tests pass.

Tests are used to make sure future feature development doesn't break existing features!

This projects uses Jasmine for testing functionality.
